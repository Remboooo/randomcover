Random album cover generator
============================

Just a fun little project I hacked together in 2015 to generate a random band name, album title and a cover for it.

Runs on <https://rotzooi.bad-bit.net/randomcover> if you want to try it.

It picks:
- A random Wikipedia page title to generate a band name
- A random quote from Wikiquote to generate an album title
- A random photo from the 'most interesting in the past 7 days' page on Flickr

I'm not sure where these instructions originated from, I think I came across it on Reddit or some such. Tweaked it a bit to generate better results.

Please keep in mind that this was just a quick and dirty fun hacking project and this is by no means production-quality code :-)
